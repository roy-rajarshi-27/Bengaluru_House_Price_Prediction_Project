# Bengaluru_House_Price_Prediction_Project
This is a machine learning project that aims to predict the prices of houses in Bangalore based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc. The project uses a dataset of Bangalore housing prices that can be found in the Bangalore House Price Data.csv file.

# Project Goals
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of houses in Bangalore. To achieve this goal, we will:

1. Analyze the dataset to gain insights into the data.
2. Preprocess the data to prepare it for machine learning.
3. Train and test several machine learning models to find the best one.
4. Deploy the best model to make predictions on new data.
# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website. You will also need to install several Python packages, including:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

# Dataset
The dataset we will be using for this project can be found in the Bangalore House Price Data.csv file. It contains the following columns:

- area_type: The type of the area (e.g., Built-up Area, Super built-up Area, Plot Area, etc.)
- availability: Whether the property is ready-to-move or still under construction
- location: The location of the property in Bangalore
- size: The size of the property in terms of bedrooms
- society: The name of the housing society
- total_sqft: The total area of the property in square feet
- bath: The number of bathrooms in the property
- balcony: The number of balconies in the property
- price: The price of the property in lakhs (1 lakh = 100,000)
# Preprocessing
Before we can train our machine learning models, we need to preprocess the data. This involves several steps, including:

- Handling missing values
- Handling categorical features
- Feature scaling
- Feature engineering

We will walk through each of these steps in the project.

# Machine Learning Models
We will train and test several machine learning models to find the best one for this problem. The models we will use include:

1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Decision Tree

We will evaluate each model using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared.


# Conclusion
In this project, we will build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of houses in Bangalore. We will analyze the dataset, preprocess the data, train and test several machine learning models, and deploy the best model to make predictions on new data.
